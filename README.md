# Project Title

Minting and Burning tokens (slc)

## Description

The contract is a basic token contract that allows for the creation, distribution, and destruction of a custom token named "sealcoin" (slc) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract owner or authorized parties can manage the token supply and perform token transfers. It can serve as a foundation for more complex token contracts, such as those used for ICOs, governance tokens, or other applications involving custom tokens on the Ethereum network.
